        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This website provides information on the entire web development
          learning process. During my web development adventure, I learned a
          variety of coding methodologies, design and debugging processes, and
          more.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is used to create the
          basic structure of a website. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets,
          used to style the HTML structure. Throughout my learning experience, I
          learned about HTML, CSS, tags, elements, and CSS properties. In my
          portfolio, I used HTML5 and CSS3.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning Git and GitHub</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system used to track code
          changes, whereas GitHub is a cloud platform for hosting Git
          repositories. I learned commands like
          <strong>git clone, git push, git pull, git commit</strong> and
          concepts like repositories and branches.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Layout</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted my portfolio to look professional, so I chose minimal and
          clean colors. I used transitions and hover effects for a modern look.
          The website includes a header and multiple sections, with anchor tags
          connecting the pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p>
          The navbar is placed at the top of the website. It includes my logo
          and links to other pages. I used the flexbox display property to align
          items horizontally. Hover effects were added to enhance user
          experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>
          The homepage includes an introduction, an image, and a link to my
          projects. I used flexbox to arrange the layout, along with padding,
          margins, and box shadows. I also added hover opacity effect to the
          image.
        </p>

        <h3>Validation for index.html</h3>
        <p>
          The homepage HTML was validated to ensure clean structure and
          correctness.
        </p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
          As a beginner, I do not have any completed projects yet. Therefore, I
          created placeholders using CSS grid layout. I used box shadows,
          border-radius, and subtle colors.
        </p>

        <h3>Validation for project.html</h3>
        <p>The projects page passed HTML validation checks.</p>

        <h2>Contact Page</h2>
        <p>
          The contact page allows users to reach me via email. It includes my
          personal details, such as email, phone number, and address. Social
          media links are also included.
        </p>

        <h3>Validation for contact.html</h3>
        <p>The contact page was checked through the HTML validator.</p>

        <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
        <p>
          The video demonstration helps users understand how the website works.
          It explains different sections and the development process, and is
          embedded directly on the page.
        </p>

        <h2>Site Report</h2>
        <h3>Validation for sitereport.html</h3>
        <p>This report page was validated through an HTML validator.</p>

        <h2>Style.css</h2>
        <h3>Validation for style.css</h3>
        <p>
          The CSS file was validated to remove any syntax errors or warnings.
        </p>

        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive design helps websites adjust to various devices and screen
          sizes. I used the viewport meta tag and media queries to ensure my
          website is responsive.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          I encountered several issues such as browser compatibility, responsive
          layout problems, and content organization. A major issue I couldn't
          solve was adding a hamburger menu for mobile view. It caused alignment
          problems, but I plan to fix it in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Through this web development journey, I learned HTML, CSS, Git, and
          GitHub. This portfolio website reflects my learning and growth in web
          development.
