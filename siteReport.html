        <p>
          
        </p>

        <h2>Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          My whole web development learning journey is chronicled on this website. I investigated fundamental ideas like HTML, CSS, layout design, version control, debugging, and responsive development while building the portfolio. The project shows the abilities I've acquired and how I used them to create a neat and useful website.

Studying CSS and HTML

Any website's structural framework is provided by HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and its presentation and styling are managed by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
This module taught me about:

HTML elements, attributes, and tags

HTML5 semantic structure

CSS properties, layout strategies, and selectors

Current HTML5 and CSS3 features

I used these ideas to create a neat, organized, and eye-catching design for every page in my portfolio.

        </p>

        <h2>Learning Git and GitHub</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system that helps track and manage changes in code. GitHub is an online platform for hosting repositories and collaborating with others.
          I practiced essential Git commands such as:
          •	git clone
          •	git add
          •	git commit
          •	git push
          •	git pull
          I also learned about branching, repository management, and the importance of commit messages. GitHub was used to store my project and maintain version history.
          
        </p>

        <h2>Design Layout</h2>
        <p>
          My design approach was centered around simplicity, clarity, and professionalism. To achieve this:
          •	I used a minimal color palette for a modern look.
          •	Transitions and hover effects were added to improve user experience.
          •	The layout includes a structured header, multiple content sections, and well-organized typography.
          •	Anchor links were used for smooth navigation between pages.
          
        </p>

        <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p>
          The navigation bar is placed at the top of all pages to ensure consistent user experience.
          Key features include:
          •	A personal logo
          •	Links to Home, Projects, Contact, and Site Report
          •	Flexbox for horizontal alignment
          •	Hover effects for better interactivity
          The navbar is clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.
          
        </p>

        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>
          The home page introduces me and provides a quick overview of the portfolio. It includes:
•	A brief introduction
•	An image representing me or my work
•	A call-to-action link directing users to my projects
Flexbox was used to align the text and image. Additional styling such as padding, shadows, and hover opacity effects enhance the presentation.

        </p>

        <h3>Validation for index.html</h3>
        <p>
          The homepage was checked through the W3C HTML validator, and any structural issues were corrected to ensure valid and clean markup.
        </p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
          As I am still at the beginning of my web development journey, I do not have completed projects yet. Therefore, I created project placeholders using CSS Grid.
The design features:
•	Card-style placeholders
•	Box shadows for depth
•	Rounded corners
•	Soft and consistent color scheme

        </p>

        <h3>Validation for project.html</h3>
        <p>The projects page passed the W3C validator test after fixing minor warnings.</p>

        <h2>Contact Page</h2>
        <p>
          The contact page allows visitors to reach me easily. It includes:
          •	Email address
          •	Phone number
          •	Social media links
          The layout is clean and simple, making the information easy to read.
          
        </p>

        <h3>Validation for contact.html</h3>
        <p>The page was validated using the HTML validator and revised where needed.</p>

        <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
        <p>
          A video demonstration was added to explain how the website functions.
It highlights:
•	The structure of each page
•	My design decisions
•	The development process
The video is embedded directly into the page for accessibility.

        </p>

        <h2>Site Report</h2>
        <h3>Validation for sitereport.html</h3>
        <p>This report page was validated through an HTML validator.</p>

        <h2>Style.css</h2>
        <h3>Validation for style.css</h3>
        <p>
          The CSS file was validated to remove any syntax errors or warnings.
        </p>

        <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>
          To ensure the website works on all devices—including laptops, tablets, and phones—I used:
•	The viewport meta tag
•	Media queries
•	Flexible units (%, rem, vh)
•	Responsive images and layouts
These techniques allow the website to adapt smoothly across various screen sizes.

        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          During development, I faced several challenges:
•	Responsive layout issues
•	Browser compatibility differences
•	Managing spacing and alignment
•	Attempting to implement a hamburger menu for mobile navigation
Although the hamburger menu caused alignment problems and is not fully functional yet, I plan to improve it in future updates.

        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This project helped me gain a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub. By building this portfolio, I improved my coding skills, design sense, and problem-solving abilities. The website reflects my progress and serves as the foundation for my future web development journey.
